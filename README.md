# github_events_actions
In this section, we are going to build an Action that runs some tests with pytest and controls the quality of your code with Flake8 when you push on your repository.

The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

Flake8 is a Python library that wraps PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and Ned Batchelder’s McCabe script. It is a great toolkit for checking your code base against coding style (PEP8), programming errors (like “library imported but unused” and “Undefined name”), and to check cyclomatic complexity.
